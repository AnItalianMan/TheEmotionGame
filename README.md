 This project is a simple game made for University of Salerno Cloud computing's course. It use some of Microsoft Azure's services, such as:    
  
* Azure computer vision service  
* Azure Speech-To-Text service  
* Azure Bing search service  
* Azure virtual machine service  
* Azure SQL  
* Azure SQL server  
  
Each subscription key can be changed in ```config.yml``` file  
## :bookmark_tabs: Architecture   
The architecture is made up by a Telegram bot, hosted on an Azure virtual machine which is used to interact with user's devices that want to play. The bot can also  
use, when needed, Azure services like the Azure cognitive service for emotion recognizing, the Speech-to-Text service for convert the audio sent on the chat in text  
and the Azure Bing Search when the user don't want to send a personal photo and want to find it on the internet. The bot also interacts with a database, which is used  
for register user the first time they play and mantain information like the number of played games and the number of times each user wins to keep a ranking of best players.

## :gear: Installation and configuration
First step is clone project and install requirements  
```bash  
git clone https://github.com/AnItalianMan/TheEmotionGame  
```  
Go to project folder and run the following command  
```bash  
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### :cloud: Create resources
You have to create a "resource group" to group all the following resources:
* Azure computer vision (Face resource)
* Azure Bing search
* Azure Speech-to-Text
* Azure SQL & Azure SQL server

Keep note of all subscriptions key for these services. You will require it for the next step.

### :musical_note: Install ffmpeg
Go to [FFmpeg download page](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html#build-linux) and download the right ffmpeg version for your OS.
It is required for converting telegram's audio from ```.oga```, which is the format provided from Telegram, to ```.wav```.

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ffmpeg
```

### :gear: Set configuration

Set right subscriptions key, obtained from past step, in ```config.yml``` file  
  
```yml  
TelegramBotToken: <bot_telegram_token>  
AzureSpeechToken: <Azure_speech_to_text_subscription_key>
AzureBingToken: <Azure_bing_search_subscription_key>  
AzureVisionToken: <Azure_computer_vision_subscription_key>  
AzureDatabase:
    DatabaseServerEndPoint: <Azure_sql_server_endpoint>  
    Username: <Azure_sql_server's_username>
    Password: <Azure_sql_server's_password>
    DatabaseName: <database_name>  
```
  
### :wrench: Create database  
Go to Azure SQL panel on Azure control panel and create the database.  
This is the script for build database.  
```sql
CREATE TABLE theemotiongame(  
	ChatID INT PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
	nickname VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
	giocate INT NOT NULL,
	vinte INT NOT NULL
)
```  

## :rocket: Run Bot  
Go to project folder and run ```app.py``` file  
    
```bash  
python app.py  
```    
 Project will be executed and the bot been ready to play.  
You can go on Telegram bot chat and write ```/start``` to start a game.  
  
## :books: Rules  
The game is composed by two players: one will have to send a photo, and the another one will have to send an audio.  
The photo must depict a person's emotion. Only italian's word are accepted, for example:
